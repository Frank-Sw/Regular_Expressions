  Output: In this lesson, we will look at the use of anchors in regular expressions. Anchors allow one to specify where within the string a 
    particular pattern should be matched. In the first lesson, you were already exposed to two different anchors. ^ to match at the start 
    of a string, and $ to match at the end of a string.

    different types or categories of characters.
