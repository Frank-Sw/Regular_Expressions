  Output: In this very short lesson, we will look at the use of anchors in 
    regular expressions. Anchors allow one to specify where within the string a 
    particular pattern should be matched. In the first lesson, you were already 
    exposed to two different anchors. "^" to match at the start of a string, and 
    "$" to match at the end of a string. Let's do an example of each again 
    quickly just to refresh your memory.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As with the previous lesson, we've loaded a text extract into the 
    object 'mice'. Use grep to check for occurence of the letter "T" at the 
    start of each line from this extract.
  CorrectAnswer: grep(pattern = "^T", x = mice)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grep(pattern = '^T', x = mice)")
  Hint: Remember to include "^" at the start of the pattern.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use grep to check for occurence of the letter "e" at the end of each 
    line from this extract.
  CorrectAnswer: grep(pattern = "e$", x = mice)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="grep(pattern = 'e$', x = mice)")
  Hint: Remember to include "$" at the end of the pattern.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A "\b" is used to match a word boundary - it can be used to match an 
    empty space on either end of a word. Note that R treats backslashes as 
    escape values for character constants (in addition to regular expressions 
    which also do so), so when supplying "\b" you'll need to escape it with 
    another backslash i.e. "\\b"
    Use grep to check for the occurence of the letter "t" again, but this time 
    only look for a match where there is a word boundary following the letter.
  CorrectAnswer: grep(pattern = "t\\b", x = mice)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="4")
  Hint: Remember you need to use "\\b" due to R's handling of "\" as an escape 
    character.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A "\B" is used to match a non-word boundary - it is precisely the 
    opposite of "\b". Use grep to check for the occurence of the letter "t" at a 
    non-word boundary in each line of the provided text extract.
  CorrectAnswer: grep(pattern = "\\Bt\\B", x = mice)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="3 4")
  Hint: Note that you'll need to check for a non-word boundary on both sides. 
    Also remember you need to use a double backslash in R.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In the next lesson, we'll explore the use of character classes in 
    regular expressions. These provide flexible ways to match different types or 
    categories of characters.
