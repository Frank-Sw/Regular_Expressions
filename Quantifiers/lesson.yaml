- Class: text
  Output: This lesson will focus on the use of quantifiers in regular 
    expressions. Quantifiers are used to indicate characters or collections of 
    characters which may be repeated in the search pattern.
    
- Class: text
  Output: The core perspective for quantifiers is very simple, but there is also
    a more advanced perspective which is important to grasp in order to gain a 
    proper understanding of how quantifiers work. We will focus on the basics 
    for now, and then progress on to the more advanced underpinnings in the 
    latter part of the lesson.
    
- Class: text
  Output: A regex quantifier tells the regex engine to match a certain quantity 
    of the character or subexpression immediately to its left. The "+" 
    quantifier indicates a match of one or more times. For example, the pattern 
    "a+" will match the text strings "apples" and "aaa" since both strings 
    contain at least one "a". 
    
- Class: text
  Output: In the case of a pattern such as "abc+abx", the quantifier 
    only applies to the character immediately to it's left (i.e. the "c"), so 
    that this pattern would match "abcccccabx" but not "abcabcabx". By contrast, 
    in the case of a pattern like "(abc)+abx", the quantifier applies to the 
    sub-expression "(abc)" and thus this pattern would match "abcabcabx" but not 
    "abcccccabx".

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the below strings would be matched by the pattern "xyz(abc)+xyz"?
  AnswerChoices: xyzxyz;xyzcxyz;xyzabcabcxyz;xyzabc
  CorrectAnswer: xyzabcabcxyz
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='xyzabcabcxyz')
  Hint: The quantifier is applied to the expression within parentheses.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: The "?" quantifier indicates a match of either 0 or 1 occurrences. For
    example, the pattern "Could be 10? or 20?" would match the strings 
    "Could be 1 or 2" and "Could be 10 or 20". Which other string(s) would 
    also be matched by this pattern?
  AnswerChoices: Could be 10 or 2 and Could be 1 or 20; Could be 100 or 200; Could be  or 
  CorrectAnswer: Could be 10 or 2 and Could be 1 or 20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Could be 10 or 2 and Could be 1 or 20")
  Hint: The "?" quantifier can match either 0 or 1 occurrences of "0" in both 
    positions within the string.

# * 0 or more
# + 1 or more
# ? 0 or 1
# {3} Exactly 3
# {3,5} 3, 4 or 5
# {3,} 3 or more
# Add a ? to a quantifier to make it ungreedy.
