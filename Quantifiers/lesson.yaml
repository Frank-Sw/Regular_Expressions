  Output: This lesson will focus the use of quantifiers in regular 
    expressions. Quantifiers are used to indicate characters or collections of 
    characters which may be repeated in the search pattern.

  Output: The core perspective for quantifiers is very simple, but there is also
    a more advanced perspective which is important to grasp in order to gain a 
    proper understanding of how quantifiers work. We will focus on the basics 
    for now, and then progress on to the more advanced underpinnings in the 
    latter part of the lesson.

  Output: A regex quantifier tells the regex engine to match a certain quantity 
    of the character or subexpression immediately to its left. The "+" 
    quantifier indicates a match of one or more times. For example, the pattern 
    "a+" will match the text strings "apples" and "aaa" since both strings 
    contain at least one "a".

  Output: Note that in the case of a pattern such as "abc+abx", the quantifier 
    only applies to the character immediately to it's left (i.e. the "c"), so 
    that this pattern would match "abcccccabx" but not "abcabcabx". By contrast, 
    the pattern "(abc)+abx" however, would match "abcabcabx" but not 
    "abcccccabx".

# * 0 or more
# + 1 or more
# ? 0 or 1
# {3} Exactly 3
# {3,5} 3, 4 or 5
# {3,} 3 or more
# Add a ? to a quantifier to make it ungreedy.
