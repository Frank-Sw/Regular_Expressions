This course will provide an overview of \r\nwhat is possible with regular expressions as they are applied in R.  \r\n  \r\nThough different programming languages often possess their own conventions and \r\nflavor when it comes to the regular expressions, the vast majority of the \r\nknowledge you will obtain from this course is transferable to regular \r\nexpressions in other programming languages.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nAt the moment this course is still very much a work in progress but please feel \r\nfree to give it a try in its current state and report any problems you have or \r\nleave suggestions for improvement on the \r\n[issues page](https://github.com/jonmcalder/Regular_Expressions/issues) as you \r\nwork through the lessons.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to submit a pull request that would be even better! :-)\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the swirl developers \r\n@[ncarchedi](https://github.com/ncarchedi), \r\n@[seankross](https://github.com/seankross), and \r\n@[WilCrofter](https://github.com/WilCrofter) as well as many others who have \r\ncontributed code and/or learning content to swirl.\r\n\r\nI would like to commend them not only for the ease of use of both swirl and \r\nswirlify, but especially for the excellent documentation surrounding the \r\nlearning and teaching components of this 'platform' as these are essential for \r\nanyone looking to get started.\r\n",
