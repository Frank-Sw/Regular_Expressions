- Class: text
  Output: This lesson will introduce the concept of groups and ranges in regular
    expressions. These allow one to mix and morph other regex pattern concepts 
    together in different ways to build more complex expressions.
    
- Class: text
  Output: The key metacharacters here are square and round brackets - "[", "]", 
    "(" and ")". Square brackets are used to define a set or range of 
    characters, where one (or more) must usually be matched in the text. For 
    example, the pattern "[abc]" will match any text which contains either an "a"
    or a "b" or "c" (as opposed to the pattern "abc" which would only match text
    containing all three letters "abc" adjacent to each other and in that 
    order at some point in the string).

- Class: text
  Output: Ranges can also be specified using a "-". As an example, the pattern 
    "[a-z]" is equivalent to the character class "[:lower:]" i.e. it will match 
    any lower case letter character. Similarly, "[A-Z]" is equivalent to 
    "[:upper:]" and will match any upper case letter character.

  Output: Which of the below patterns would match "xxxxyyyyyzzzzz"
  AnswerChoices: pattern = "xyz";pattern = "[a-w]";pattern = "[yz]";pattern = "a-z"
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = "[yz]"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="pattern = '[yz]'")
  Hint: Expressions not contained square brackets require an exact match.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Character classes can also be combined within square brackets to 
    specify more broad ranges. The pattern "[[:lower:][:upper:]]" will match any 
    alphabetic characters (lower or upper-case), and is thus equivalent to 
    "[:alpha:]". Another equivalent pattern would be "[A-z]".

  Output: In the next lesson, we'll explore the use of quantifiers in regular 
    expressions. Quantifiers specify how many repetitions of a pattern should be 
    matched.
