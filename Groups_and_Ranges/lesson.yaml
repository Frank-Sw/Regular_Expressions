- Class: text
  Output: This lesson will introduce the concept of groups and ranges in regular
    expressions. These allow one to mix and morph other regex pattern concepts 
    together in different ways to build more complex expressions.
    
- Class: text
  Output: The key metacharacters here are square and round brackets - "[", "]", 
    "(" and ")". Square brackets are used for ranges within a regular expression, 
    and round brackets (or parentheses) are used to create groups within a regular 
    expression. First we'll look at ranges.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Square brackets are used to define a set or range of 
    characters, where one (or more) must usually be matched in the text. For 
    example, the pattern "[abc]" will match any text which contains either an "a"
    or a "b" or "c" (as opposed to the pattern "abc" which would only match text
    containing all three letters "abc" adjacent to each other and in that 
    order at some point in the string).

- Class: text
  Output: Ranges can also be specified using a "-". As an example, the pattern 
    "[a-z]" is equivalent to the character class "[:lower:]" i.e. it will match 
    any lower case letter character. Similarly, "[A-Z]" is equivalent to 
    "[:upper:]" and will match any upper case letter character.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the below patterns would match "xxxxyyyyyzzzzz"
  AnswerChoices: pattern = "xyz";pattern = "[a-w]";pattern = "[yz]";pattern = "a-z"
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = "[yz]"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='pattern = "[yz]"')
  Hint: Expressions not contained square brackets require an exact match.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Character classes can also be combined within square brackets to 
    specify more broad ranges. The pattern "[[:lower:][:upper:]]" will match any 
    alphabetic characters (lower or upper-case), and is thus equivalent to 
    "[:alpha:]". Another equivalent pattern would be "[A-z]".

- Class: text
  Output: Note also that custom ranges such as "a-d" and "4-7" can be combined 
    directly within square brackets without nesting e.g. "[a-c1-3]" is 
    equivalent to "[abc123]".

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the below patterns would match "12345"?
  AnswerChoices: pattern = "[:lower:]";pattern = "[A-d6-9]";pattern = "[[:upper:][a-z]]";pattern = "[a-c2-4]"
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = "[a-c2-4]"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='pattern = "[a-c2-4]"')
  Hint: Simply look for the pattern which contains an overlapping numeric range.

- Class: text
  Output: A range can be negated by including a "^" at the beginning. For 
    example, "[^abc]" will match any character other than "a", "b" or "c". This 
    is useful to know since complex patterns can often be expressed more simply 
    (or at least more succinctly), by specifying and then negating their 
    complement.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the below patterns is the odd one out?
  AnswerChoices: pattern = "[^0-9]";pattern = "[^[:digit:]]";pattern = "[A-z]";pattern = "[\\D]"
  CorrectAnswer: pattern = "[A-z]"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='pattern = "[A-z]"')
  Hint: Don't forget about special characters.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now let's look at groups. To create a group within a regular expression,
    one simply wraps part of the expression in a set of parentheses. For example, 
    the pattern "item_[0-1][1-9][a-z]" matches strings like "item_01a", 
    "item_10b", "item_19c" etc. The pattern "item_([0-1][1-9])([a-z])" is 
    entirely equivalent, except it also captures the the item number (e.g. '01') 
    and item letter (e.g. 'b') as groups within this pattern.
    
- Class: text
  Output: These groups can then be referenced within the match and/or have other 
    regex operators applied to them. In R, the captured groups can be referenced 
    with '\\1', '\\2' up to '\\9'.
    
- Class: text
  Output: So for example, using R's `sub()` function outlined in one of the earlier 
    lessons one could transform these strings to make the numbering more explicit 
    (remember `sub()` takes a pattern and replacement value and replaces the 
    matched pattern with the replacement value).
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you expect the output of 
    sub("item_([0-1][1-9])([a-z])", "item_num_\\1_sec_\\2", "item_02c") to be?
  AnswerChoices: item_num_02_sec_c;item_num_sec_02c
  CorrectAnswer: item_num_02_sec_c
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="item_num_02_sec_c")
  Hint: The output should contain 'num' before the digits and 'sec' before the letter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In the next lesson, we'll explore the use of quantifiers in regular 
    expressions. Quantifiers specify how many repetitions of a pattern should be 
    matched, and are often used in combination with groups and ranges.
